                Making a decision to do something – this is the first step. We
                all know that nothing moves until someone makes a decision. The
                first action is always in making the decision to proceed.

                Focus is having the unwavering attention to complete what you
                set out to do. There are a million distractions in every facet
                of our lives. Telephones and e-mail, clients and managers,
                spouses and kids, TV, newspapers and radio – the distractions
                are everywhere and endless. Everyone wants a piece of us and the
                result can be totally overwhelming.

                So, how can we stay on course with all the distractions in our
                lives? Willpower is a good start, but it’s very difficult to
                stay on track simply through willpower.

                We also know those epic stories, those modern-day legends
                surrounding the early failures of such supremely successful
                folks as Michael Jordan and Bill Gates. We can look a bit
                further back in time to Albert Einstein or even further back to
                Abraham Lincoln. What made each of these people so successful?

              <p>
                If success is a process with a number of defined steps, commit
                your decision to paper, just to bring it into focus. Without
                clarity, you send a very garbled message out to the Universe.
                You will run aground and become hopelessly stuck in the mud
                simply by asking ourselves lots of questions.
